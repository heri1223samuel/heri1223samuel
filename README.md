# 👋 Hi, I’m heri1223samuel  

👀 **I’m passionate about web development**, especially creating modern, user-friendly interfaces using **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **React (TSX)**.  
🌱 **I’m currently learning** advanced React concepts, improving my UI/UX skills with **Material-UI (MUI)**, and also **developing in backend with Node.js**, which I already practice and now want to **deepen** as part of my path toward **full-stack development**.  
💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on** open-source or team-based web development projects to sharpen my skills in TypeScript, React, Node.js, and scalable web app architecture.

### 🚀 Side Project  
For the past **2 months**, I’ve been working on a **private project** built with **TypeScript** and **React (MUI)**.  
- The app is already **fully responsive**, working seamlessly across **all devices**.  
- It will become a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** once the project is finished.  
- I decided to keep it **private** for now because it’s still an **original idea**, and I want to avoid **plagiarism** or **idea copying**.  

👉 If anyone is interested, feel free to **reach out to me directly**.  
The project will later transition into **React Native** to support mobile platforms.

- I’m currently studying **computer science and programming**, always motivated to expand my knowledge and explore new technologies.  
- Proficient in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **React**, with hands-on experience in **backend development with Node.js** that I want to **further deepen**.  
- Passionate about building **dynamic, responsive, and scalable** web applications.
